# 🔍 Find the RIGHT Google Cloud Project (Firebase Issue)

## The Problem

Based on your Reddit post, Firebase might have created a **hidden Google Cloud project** that you can't see from your Google Cloud Console account. This is a common issue!

---

## ✅ Step 1: Check Firebase Console Project Settings

### A. Go to Firebase Console

1. **Open:** https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select project:** `pacematch-gps`
3. **Click:** ⚙️ **Settings** (gear icon) → **Project settings**

### B. Find Google Cloud Project Info

1. Scroll down to **"Your project"** section
2. Look for:
   - **Project ID:** Should be `pacematch-gps`
   - **Project number:** Should be `891545961086`
   - **Google Cloud project:** Click to view in Google Cloud Console

3. **Click "View in Google Cloud Console"** or note the project ID

---

## ✅ Step 2: Check ALL Google Cloud Projects

### A. List All Projects You Have Access To

1. **Go to:** https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Click the project dropdown** (top bar, shows current project)
3. **Look at the list** - you might see:
   - `pacematch-gps` (the one you're looking at)
   - Other projects you didn't know existed
   - Projects created by Firebase automatically

### B. Check Each Project for Android OAuth Client ID

For **EACH project** in the list:

1. **Select the project** from dropdown
2. **Go to:** APIs & Services → Credentials
3. **Look for Android OAuth Client ID** with:
   - Package name: `com.pacematch.app`
   - SHA-1: `81:55:30:46:0C:B0:FC:A5:49:B8:96:F6:0B:CE:48:B6:B3:F9:ED:CD`

---

## ✅ Step 3: Check Firebase Android App Settings

### A. In Firebase Console

1. **Go to:** Firebase Console → `pacematch-gps` project
2. **Click:** ⚙️ **Settings** → **Project settings**
3. **Scroll to:** "Your apps" section
4. **Find your Android app** (or add it if missing)
   - Package name: `com.pacematch.app`
5. **Click on the Android app**
6. **Look for:** "SHA certificate fingerprints"
   - This shows which SHA-1s are registered
   - Note: Firebase might be managing this separately!

### B. Check if SHA-1 is in Firebase

If you see your SHA-1 `81:55:30:46:0C:B0:FC:A5:49:B8:96:F6:0B:CE:48:B6:B3:F9:ED:CD` in Firebase:
- Firebase might be interfering
- You might need to remove it from Firebase (if not using Firebase Auth)
- Or add it to the linked Google Cloud project

---

## ✅ Step 4: Find the Linked Google Cloud Project

### Method A: From Firebase

1. **Firebase Console** → Project Settings → General tab
2. Scroll to **"Project resources"**
3. Look for **"Google Cloud project"**
4. Click the link to open it in Google Cloud Console

### Method B: Check Project Number

Your Firebase config shows:
- **Project number:** `891545961086`
- **Project ID:** `pacematch-gps`

1. **Go to:** https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=pacematch-gps
2. **Check URL** - does it show `project=pacematch-gps`?
3. **If yes:** This is the correct project
4. **If no:** Note which project ID is in the URL

---

## 🔧 Step 5: Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: OAuth Client ID is in Different Project

**If you find the Android OAuth Client ID in a DIFFERENT project:**

1. **Option A:** Create a new one in the `pacematch-gps` project
2. **Option B:** Use the existing one from the other project (if it has correct values)

**To create in `pacematch-gps`:**
1. Make sure you're in `pacematch-gps` project
2. Go to: APIs & Services → Credentials
3. Create Android OAuth Client ID with:
   - Package: `com.pacematch.app`
   - SHA-1: `81:55:30:46:0C:B0:FC:A5:49:B8:96:F6:0B:CE:48:B6:B3:F9:ED:CD`

### Scenario 2: Firebase is Managing OAuth Client IDs

**If Firebase created them automatically:**

1. **Go to:** Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
2. **Check:** Google Sign-in provider settings
3. **Look for:** OAuth Client IDs mentioned there
4. You might need to configure them through Firebase, not Google Cloud Console directly

### Scenario 3: Multiple Projects with Same Name

**If you see multiple projects with similar names:**

- `pacematch-gps` (Firebase project)
- `pacematch-gps-xxxxx` (Auto-generated by Firebase)
- Check ALL of them for OAuth Client IDs

---

## ✅ Step 6: Verify You're in the Right Project

### Quick Check

1. **Current URL should be:**
   ```
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=pacematch-gps
   ```

2. **Top bar should show:**
   - Project dropdown shows: `pacematch-gps`
   - Project number: `891545961086`

3. **If different:**
   - Click project dropdown
   - Select `pacematch-gps`
   - Wait for page to reload
   - Try again

## 🔍 Still Can't Find It?

### Try These:

1. **Check Firebase Authentication Settings:**
